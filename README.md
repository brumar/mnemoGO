### Description
scripts to deal with some needs I encountered with sgf file :
#### Script 1
- Convert joseki to number-based coordinate (in order to memorize it with a number-based memory system) (convertToNumberBasedCoordinates.py)
Note that some numbers can match several different intersections.
Usefull if you are a go geek and a mnemotechnics geek

#### Script 2
- Convert tsumego problems for white to tsumego problems for black (convertToBlackMove.py).
Usefull for applications like Elygo which assumes that black is always the first to play in tsumego

Contact me if you want use it but if you have not the background knowledge to adapt it for your own needs.
